## TODO

Spotlight still doesn't work properly          - Solved: the FragPos variable in the vertex shader was incorrectly multiplied with the view matrix
Material specular texture map cannot load      - Solved: Needed to specify the position with "updateUniform("material.specular", 1);"
The loaded texture is shifted on objects       - Solved: The Cube texture coords were in wrong order
Windows compatibility (GLEW, GLFW3, SDL2, GLM) - Solved with vcpkg and Visual Studio Clang
WASD should move horizontally                  - Solved: GetHorizontalForward() function
Scene object 
Light handling object
Blending objects should be drawn based on distance from the camera
Mirror effect

# Windows

Install clang in Visual Studio Installer
Install vcpkg (optionally: add it to PATH)
Run the following command: vcpkg install opengl glfw3 sdl2 glm glew --triplet=x64-windows

Add the vcpkg toolchain file path to your project:

./.vscode/settings.json
{
  "cmake.configureSettings": {
    "VCPKG_TARGET_TRIPLET": "x64-windows",
    "CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE": "C:/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake"
  }
}
