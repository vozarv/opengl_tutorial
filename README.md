## TODO

Spotlight still doesn't work properly
Material specular texture map cannot load
The loaded texture is shifted on objects - Solved: The Cube texture coords were in wrong order
Windows compatibility (GLEW, GLFW3, SDL2, GLM)
WASD should move horizontally - Solved: GetHorizontalForward() function
Scene object 
Light handling object


# Windows

Install clang in Visual Studio Installer
Install vcpkg (optionally: add it to PATH)
Run the following command: vcpkg install opengl glfw3 sdl2 glm glew --triplet=x64-windows
=======
Blending objects should be drawn based on distance from the camera
